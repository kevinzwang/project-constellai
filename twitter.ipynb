Now on @undisputed, Charles Barkley said after last night’s Lakers game on TNT that Memphis should be “happy” about what it had just seen. We debate now on @undisputed, Mavs are optimistic they can sign Kyrie… which would be a huge mistake. Now on @undisputed, I’m not as sold on this Memphis team like I was last year. There’s growing focus on Ja Morant and the Grizzlies. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Buckle up: Shannon and I are about to give LeBron a letter grade for last night. Now on @undisputed, I remain slightly encouraged because as I correctly predicted, the Lakers took off at the trade deadline thanks to Rob Pelinka, NBA Executive of the Year. More @undisputed, now on FS1., I’m about to unleash on the Heat. Now on @undisputed, Pelicans executives and players are NOT HAPPY with Zion, who has been cleared to play by team doctors. Now on @undisputed, Dillon Brooks said yesterday he “wouldn’t mind playing LeBron.” Be careful what you wish for??? Now on @undisputed, Last night, the Lakers won in spite of LeBron. Now on @undisputed, Tonight, LeBron will… Now on @undisputed, Eddie House joins us to debate how much the West should fear the Lakers? Now on @undisputed, Shannon loves the Thunder to win at New Orleans. I don’t. Now on @undisputed, If you blow two Play-In games at home, that would be a really bad late-career look for The King. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Darvin Ham says “sky’s the limit” for the Lakers. Agree? Now on @undisputed, Now Draymond says he’s gained respect for Rudy Gobert because he stood up to Kyle Anderson. Now on @undisputed, This was a desperate move. The Ravens outrageously overpaid a receiver coming off two ACL reconstructions at age 30, while continuously outrageously UNDERPAYING their quarterback. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Now the Hawks are ready to trade Trae Young? No surprise to me. Now on @undisputed, That didn’t look like a punch to me.

Now on @undisputed, Looks to me the Ravens are trying to bamboozle Lamar by signing Odell. Now on @undisputed, SHOCKER: RUDY GOBERT SUSPENDED FOR TONIGHT’S GAME AT LAKERS WHEN IT DIDN’T APPEAR HE DESERVED TO BE. WE DEBATE NOW ON @undisputed, I thought OBJ would accept his fate and go to the Jets. Aaron Rodgers and OBJ would have been the center of the media universe. More @undisputed, now on FS1., LeBron finished 143 of 149 among three-point shooters. He'll be jacking up 3’s in the Play-In. More @undisputed, now on FS1., This is not what Rudy Gobert is made of.

Now on @undisputed, The more Cam talked, the more I got confused. I have no idea how you can rank the QBs that you'd be willing to backup like you did. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Tyreek says he was happy for the Chiefs winning the Super Bowl. Believe him? Now on @undisputed, How far can the Clippers go with Russell Westbrook as their starting point guard? Now on @undisputed, How much faith should Shannon lose in his Lakers after last night’s loss? I say none. Now on @undisputed, Mark Cuban says his goal is to re-sign Kyrie. I can’t believe Luka will love that. Now on @undisputed, The more Cam Newton tries to clarify, the more confusing it gets. Now on @undisputed, I'm going to give LeBron a break here because he’s 38 and has high milage on his body. I was happy and impressed that both LeBron &amp;amp; AD said \"let’s go\" before tip-off. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Will the Lakers make the playoffs or only the Play-In? That all depends on whether Kevin Durant plays back-to-back Friday night at Lakers. Now on @undisputed, Mark Cuban tries to talk his way out of the mistake he made not re-signing Jalen Brunson. Now on @undisputed, Angel Reese says she will not go to the White House and would prefer to go see the Obamas. Now on @undisputed, Why last night’s Lakers-Clippers game just might have been the weirdest game I’ve ever watched. Now on @undisputed, Should LeBron play tonight? Now on @undisputed, Is it possible Jordan Poole is now the most valuable Warrior? Now on @undisputed, LeBron wanted Russell Westbrook. Then he wanted Russell Westbrook gone. So how will Russ react tonight against the Lakers? Now on @undisputed, Is Joel Embiid now The Best Player on the Planet? Now on @undisputed, Luka does a rare post-practice interview and talks about how much he misses Jalen Brunson and how little chemistry the Mavs now have. Listening, Kyrie? Now on @undisputed, Joel Embiid is the MVP and he cemented his case last night. More @undisputed, now on FS1., BILL BELICHICK HAS TRIED TO TRADE MAC JONES??? NOW ON @undisputed, I love mad LeBron. When he gets mad, he can channel his anger. He just sticks it to you. More @undisputed, now on FS1., The Clippers have won 10 straight games against the Lakers. So how important is tonight’s Clippers “home” game against the Lakers? HUGELY. Now on @undisputed, Our First Lady now only wants LSU to come to the White House. We react now on @undisputed, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE JOEL EMBIID. NOW ON @undisputed, WAS LEBRON REALLY GOOD OR REALLY BAD - OR BOTH - LAST NIGHT AT UTAH? NOW ON @undisputed, It now sounds like Arizona will cut DeAndre Hopkins. Shocking. Now on @undisputed, At some point, I believe Robert Kraft will be forced to relieve Bill Belichick of his duties. Now on @undisputed, Jalen Carter’s agent Drew Rosenhaus says he will only visit teams picking in the Top 10. Hmmm. Now on @undisputed, Peter King reports the Texans might just throw a curveball at No. 2 and take defensive end Will Anderson instead of a quarterback. WHAT!? Now on @undisputed, This was a swing and a miss. Mark Cuban traded Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 1st round pick AND two 2nd round picks for Kyrie Irving, who has been a bust — at least in the win column. More @undisputed, now on FS1. <br />https://t.co/so8bPhtoZc, Shannon has already bet me that the Celtics will go 4-0 against the Sixers by winning tonight at Philly. He’s wrong. Now on @undisputed, RAVENS OFFER ODELL A CONTRACT. WHAT COULD THAT MEAN FOR LAMAR? NOW ON @undisputed, This is so bad, it’s close to being an SNL skit. It’s so sad, it’s almost funny sad. You don’t need to pat the Iowa women on the head and say, “oh you poor girls.” More @undisputed, now on FS1., I can’t believe I’m asking this question: Is it possible the Lakers win out and wind up the 5-seed? Now on @undisputed, The Mavs are considering shutting down Luka and Kyrie with three games to go, with the Mavs only one game out of the Play-In??? Now on @undisputed, WAIT, JILL BIDEN WANTS BOTH LSU AND IOWA TO COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER LSU BEAT IOWA TO WIN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP??? NOW ON @undisputed, What in the name of Steph Curry has happened to Steph Curry? Now on @undisputed, HERE COME THE LAKERS. NOW ON @undisputed, We’re about to dive into the Angel Reese vs Caitlin Clark controversy. Now on @undisputed, More inexplicable quotes from Mike McCarthy. Now on @undisputed, This NBA MVP race is going down to the wire. We debate now on @undisputed, You’ve got two guys who on any given night can be unguardable, and they do exactly the same thing. It will only work for three quarters, not four. Every 4th quarter has been one long pout between Luka and Kyrie. More @undisputed, now on FS1, Kyrie’s legacy is teetering. Now on @undisputed, I’m liking this Laker team more and more. Now on @undisputed, Deion Sanders tweets about Lamar Jackson. We respond now on @undisputed, DLo is a talent, Austin Reaves is proving he belongs in this league and in this lineup, and LeBron is refreshed. You’ve got something here. More @undisputed, now on FS1, We’re about to evaluate KD’s return. Now on @undisputed, Russell Westbrook’s astonishing performance: blip or trend? Now on @undisputed, More to blame, Kyrie or Luka? Now on @undisputed, Is it possible LeBron’s Lakers are now positioned to make a run at winning his 5th ring? Now on @undisputed, Bradley Beal was involved in an incident with a fan. Bradley Beal knows better. Now on @undisputed, Ben Simmons shut down for the rest of the season. Will he ever be an All-Star again? Now on @undisputed, The unending feud between Isiah Thomas and Michael Jordan escalates. What does this say about Jordan? Now on @undisputed, KEVIN DURANT IS BACK. SHOULD PHOENIX NOW BE THE FAVORITE TO WIN IT ALL? NOW ON @undisputed, The NFL approves the use of No. 0. Micah wanted it but Jayron Kearse beat him to the punch. Now on @undisputed, Lamar Jackson is a QB who can win a Super Bowl for you and is a former MVP. Quarterbacks always get a lot of money because it's the premium position. HE IS PROVEN! More @undisputed, now on FS1., Because of the social media world, the pressure on this kid is staggering to me. The pressure is equal to what his father went through because there’s more of it today. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Mike McCarthy says all he needs is for Dak to play 20 games next season. Huh??? Now on @undisputed, IS LAMAR JACKSON A VICTIM OF NFL COLLUSION? NOW ON @undisputed, Draymond and the Warriors were chest-beating after their comeback from 20 down at home against the Pels. I’m still not buying. Now on @undisputed, BRONNY LIGHTS UP THE MCDONALD’S GAME WITH 5 3’S INCLUDING A LATE CLUTCH ONE. A YEAR FROM NOW, WILL HE BE ABLE TO PLAY ALONGSIDE HIS DAD IN THE NBA? NOW ON @undisputed, Russ rocks the baby on Pat Bev. Now on @undisputed, I still believe Trey Lance will turn out to be better than Brock Purdy. Now on @undisputed, Belichick’s response to disgruntled Patriots fans “see the last 25 years.” HUH??? What about the last three seasons? Now on @undisputed, Shannon is fired up about the pass Luka pulled off last night. I’m not. Now on @undisputed, Who’s most to blame for this Lamar Jackson stalemate? Now on @undisputed, I loved what Doc Rivers did before this game. It was a perfect move to say he believes that Joel already won MVP, and all that matters to this team is winning the East. I love their chances. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Bronny finished 2nd last night in the McDonald’s dunk contest. We react now on @undisputed, I LOVED every word that came out of Gutekunst’s mouth yesterday. He went scorched earth and put it all on Aaron Rodgers, who I have always said is a master manipulator. More @undisputed, now on FS1., JOEL EMBIID, MVP! NOW ON @undisputed, You have to step back from all this and say: “Wait a second! It’s LAMAR JACKSON!” He’s there for the  taking.

Now on @undisputed, Cowboy-killer Aaron Jones - Green Bay’s most valuable Aaron - joins us now on @undisputed, I’m about to tell Austin Ekeler why Kellen Moore will turn the Chargers into AFC Champions. Now on @undisputed, The Suns gave up three nice pieces but not their big pieces. I'm betting on Monty Williams to rise and shine like the sun. He's the center of this universe. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Why Jalen Hurts is more valuable than Patrick Mahomes. Now on @undisputed, NO MORE RUSSELL WESTBROOK. NOW ON @undisputed, How may points will Kyrie score tonight without Luka in his Dallas debut in LeBron’s house? Now on @undisputed, WHY DIDN’T ANTHONY DAVIS STAND AND CELEBRATE WHEN LEBRON PASSED KAREEM? NOW ON @undisputed, How much farther will LeBron be able to extend his scoring record?

More @undisputed, now on FS1., Shannon is about to share what it was like sitting courtside last night. Now on @undisputed, It is an all-time longevity/durability record. LeBron and Kareem have something in common: Kareem was the first to understand fitness and nutrition. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Aaron Rodgers announces he’s about to go on an isolation retreat.

Now on @undisputed, Should I give LeBron and the Lakers a pass for losing last night to the Thunder? Now on @undisputed, Last night did LeBron finally completely close his GOAT case? Uh… Now on @undisputed, Exactly how impressive was LeBron passing Kareem? Well… Now on @undisputed, TODAY I WILL CALL HIM KING JAMES. NOW ON @undisputed, LEBRON’S GREATEST MOMENT. NOW ON @undisputed, When Kareem passed Wilt to become the all-time leading scorer, Dr. Jerry Buss wasn’t even in attendance. Will it ever be different tonight. Now on @undisputed, LeBron is a below average jump shooter, free throw shooter and it wasn't a strength of his to shoot 3's. Yet here he is. It's miraculous. He's played the greatest brand of bully ball I've ever seen. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Why Kyrie and Luka will not work. Now on @undisputed, There’s a new sheriff in Denver: Sean Payton. You listening, Russell Wilson? Now on @undisputed, LeBron’s going to do it tonight. The Thunder just got routed at Golden State and gave up 141 points. I don’t see how anybody can stop LeBron doing what he does greatest which is attack the basket.  More @undisputed, now on FS1.<br /><br />https://t.co/abdReCiqqT, LeBron says it’s “mind-boggling” that he’s about to pass Kareem. It sure is.

Now on @undisputed, The clock ticks: How soon will KD issue another trade demand? Now on @undisputed, I first called out Ja after they won Game 2 against the Timberwolves.

Now on @undisputed, KD has a little bit of Kyrie in him — I don’t know if winning is a huge priority. He did it twice, so to KD it’s, “been there and done all that.” More @undisputed, now on FS1., Now what shot do you give the Mavs of winning the West? Now on @undisputed, If three of the top four Super Bowl players are Chiefs, then how can the Eagles be favored? Now on @undisputed, Jeanie doesn't want to go over the edge for a Kyrie Irving whose track record screams no, no, no, no. But I will say this: there's one human out there who can win with Kyrie, and that's LeBron James. More @undisputed, now on FS1., NBA issues bans after investigating postgame incident involving acquaintances of Ja Morant. Now on @undisputed, At a glance, it looks like Dallas stole Kyrie.

More @undisputed, now on FS1., How much was LeBron to blame for the Lakers blowing another lead to an inferior team Saturday at New Orleans? Now on @undisputed, Where does this leave KD?

NOW ON @undisputed, I keep waiting for this Lakers team to win a game by 15 or 20 points. They aren’t capable of it. More @undisputed, now on FS1., WHEN WILL LEBRON BREAK THE RECORD? NOW ON @undisputed, Pardon me while I yawn at this. To Donovan’s point, Dillon Brooks has been doing this for 5 seasons. He thinks this enhances his basketball brand. More @undisputed, now on FS1., ALL-STAR SNUBS. NOW ON @undisputed, I’m not diminishing what LeBron’s about to accomplish but you can't go there. That's hallowed.

NOW ON @undisputed, LeBron says breaking Kareem’s all-time scoring record is “right up there” with all the baseball HR records. Uh, no. Now on @undisputed, Why has Steph Curry disappeared in so many overtime losses for the Warriors? Now on @undisputed, I love listening to this man Deion. Whatever he’s selling I’m buying. More @undisputed, now on FS1., WILL LEBRON RIGHT HIS WRONG AGAINST INDIANA TONIGHT? NOW ON @undisputed, What was Tom Brady’s greatest moment? There wasn’t one. Now on @undisputed, Because LeBron is averaging 35 a game, he's on the doorstep of this scoring record before I was even ready. He is on an all-time, torrential tear. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Did the Celtics prove last night they’re the best in the East? NOPE. Sixers are. Now on @undisputed, On National Signing Day, Deion Sanders speaks out about how there’s now “hope in the house” at Colorado. Now on @undisputed, He’s been interviewed 15 times for head coaching jobs. It's so unfair to him because he can't win now. He has no choice but to go lateral. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Exactly when will LeBron pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time scoring leader? Now on @undisputed, Jerry Jones speaks out on why Mike McCarthy will call plays next season. I unleash. Now on @undisputed, Should Eric Bieniemy agree to become Lamar Jackson’s offensive coordinator? Now on @undisputed, Reportedly, Tom Brady didn’t want to play anywhere but Tampa Bay. But he was too emotionally exhausted to return. We react now on @undisputed, My favorite Brady moment of all-time might be what he did in Arrowhead against Mahomes in the AFC Championship. More @undisputed, now on FS1., I was shocked that LeBron got off to a quiet start in MSG. I wanted him to do what he did at Boston. More @undisputed, now on FS1., If in fact the 49ers and Raiders were interested in signing Tom Brady, where does this leave them now? Now on @undisputed, LeBron rises above Mark Jackson and Steve Nash for 4th place on the all-time assists list. How impressive is this? Now on @undisputed, Where would you rank Tom Brady’s career all-time in all sports? Now on @undisputed, DEMECO RYANS TO THE TEXANS. NOW ON @undisputed, Sean Payton to the Broncos. Maybe Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs won’t own this division any longer. Now on @undisputed, How will you remember Tom Brady? Now on @undisputed, We're about to critique LeBron’s performance last night at Madison Square Garden. Now on @undisputed, TOM BRADY ANNOUNCES HIS RETIREMENT. AND THIS TIME IT FEELS LIKE IT’S FOR GOOD. NOW ON @undisputed, Kyrie lauds LeBron - the same Kyrie who left LeBron to go to the Celtics. Now on @undisputed, It’s clear Mike McCarthy won the power struggle with Kellen Moore. McCarthy wanted to call the plays, because he did it for 13 years in Green Bay. But Moore will thrive in Los Angeles. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Germaine Pratt apologizes for blasting teammate Joseph Ossai. Now on @undisputed, Wait, Russell Westbrook just passed Gary Payton for 10th on the all-time assist list? Shocking. Now on @undisputed, Luka, motivated by the trash talk from a Pistons’ assistant coach, goes for 53. What was the assistant thinking? Now on @undisputed, I do feel sorry for Joe Burrow. The essence of the game in Kansas City was that Patrick Mahomes got mostly protected and Joe Burrow mostly did not. It comes down to: does the QB have time or NOT?! More @undisputed, now on FS1., What does it mean for the Cowboys to lose Kellen Moore and the Chargers to gain him?

Now on @undisputed, A lot of those Eagles fans rooting like crazy for Jalen Hurts yesterday couldn’t understand why the Eagles drafted him in the 2nd Round. Now on @undisputed, Did Mahomes prove he’s better than Burrow? Please. Now on @undisputed, I thought there was a little part of LeBron that was relieved he didn’t have to go shoot the free throws. But he was justifiably outraged. More @undisputed, now on FS1.<br /> <br />https://t.co/5vzEkcF65D, KELLEN MOORE FIRED: I AM OUTRAGED. NOW ON @undisputed, The Eagles were at a 9 on the impressive scale. The eye and smell test told you they were just the better team. The Eagles have firepower in both trenches. More @undisputed, now on FS1.<br /> <br />https://t.co/7XZ6Wa7vb1, Eagles open as a 1.5-point favorite over Mahomes and the Chiefs. Sounds about right to me.

The Tokyo Dome is one possible host venue. WBSC President Riccardo Fraccari told me the tournament could consist of two 6-team groups prior to the semifinal and final. @MLBNetwork 🇯🇵, . @WBSC President Riccardo Fraccari told me of the @WBCBaseball: “The real value in the tournament is showing how important it is to internationalize our sport.

Seriously. If you check your scorecard, that’s how it’s lining up. 👀 @MLBNetwork @MLB, Shohei Ohtani, entering the bullpen. He last appeared in relief in 2016, according to our ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ researcher Kevin Dillon. @MLB ⁦⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ 🇯🇵 https://t.co/0tCrPkFgTw, News: Shohei Ohtani just walked to the Team Japan bullpen. @MLBNetwork, Yu Darvish on his way to the bullpen.

Listen to the awe and applause after the prodigious BP home run. 👀 @MLB ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ 🇯🇵 https://t.co/wbpmAHINFt, Japan is 5-0 in this @WBCBaseball, but tonight they need to overcome a trend in recent tournaments:<br /><br />Teams traveling across the Pacific have lost 5 straight semifinals. <br /><br />2013: PR defeats JPN; DR defeats NED<br />2017: PR defeats NED; USA defeats JPN<br />2023: USA defeats CUB<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Amazing experience to work with @RichWaltz, Buck Martinez and our outstanding @MLBNetwork crew. Loved our conversations on and off the air. I’ll cherish those memories forever. ⚾️ @WBCBaseball, Great line from Paul Goldschmidt. <br /><br />I asked what he told @treavturner after his 2nd HR tonight. <br /><br />Goldy joked: “Quit showing us up!” <br /><br />The NL MVP is one of the classiest players in the game. Really enjoyed this postgame conversation. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB <br />https://t.co/g0HzfH8XGk, Cedric Mullins has his ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ moment with a HR to straightaway CF, and ⁦@USABaseball⁩ is 3 outs from the final! Join us on ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ for postgame coverage after the final out. @MLB https://t.co/PfR17I3098, Trea Turner homers AGAIN! <br /><br />USA 12, Cuba 2. <br /><br />\"M-V-P! M-V-P!\" is the chant from fans behind the U.S. dugout. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @USABaseball @Phillies @MLB, Paul Goldschmidt with a gorgeous 2-run single. He has 4 RBI tonight — and Team USA may have another ballgame to play on Tuesday night. @MLBNetwork, USA 6, Cuba 1, after Nolan Arenado’s run-scoring triple and Paul Goldschmidt’s brilliant baserunning. The U.S. has scored in every inning. Through 4 innings, this might be the most complete effort we’ve seen from Team USA in this @WBCBaseball. @MLBNetwork @MLB, As I reported on our broadcast, Trea Turner just threw away one of his batting gloves in a dugout garbage bin. The ferocity of his last HR swing apparently split the material. Still, I was stunned. I thought ballplayers were superstitious. 😂 @MLBNetwork @Phillies @MLB, USA. Cuba. They meet in the @WBCBaseball for the first time, moments from now. @MLBNetwork @MLB https://t.co/aUgLWOg2Na, Yoenis Cespedes (52) se ha regresado al equipo nacional de Cuba. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@FOXDeportes⁩ ⁦@LasMayores⁩ https://t.co/NfCrXx0IMF, Nolan Arenado talked with me about the key moments last night — and the meaning of the first 🇺🇸-🇨🇺 matchup in @WBCBaseball play, with a final berth on the line. @MLBNetwork https://t.co/WZ7E8uFYxy, Team USA’s Ernie Young and Team Cuba’s Pedro Luis Lazo were on opposite sides of the historic gold medal game between 🇺🇸 and 🇨🇺 23 years ago. Here they are today before the ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ semifinal. Thanks to Ernie for sharing the great photo. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ @MLB https://t.co/WdntTBO5Gg, USA hero Trea Turner, South Florida native, remembers catching one foul ball as a young fan at @Marlins games. <br /><br />Ken Griffey Jr. hit it. <br /><br />Last night, Junior hugged Turner in the U.S. dugout after the go-ahead grand slam. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @Phillies @MLB <br />https://t.co/eY8CvByjKA, Nolan Arenado on @treavturner during our postgame @MLBNetwork interview: <br /><br />“Wow. What a swing. What a player.” https://t.co/WZ7E8uFYxy, Trea Turner told me tonight: “Probably the loudest game I’ve ever played — ever.”<br /><br />Of note, Turner has played 43 @MLB postseason games, including a victorious 7-game World Series. <br /><br />👀<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, I said to @treavturner: “You enter the dugout, and Ken Griffey Jr. — your hitting coach — gives you a hug. To the kid from Lake Worth, Fla., how does that sound?”<br /><br />His answer: “Stupid . . . That sounds crazy.”<br /><br />😂<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB @Phillies <br />https://t.co/eY8CvByjKA, In our @MLBNetwork interview, Nolan Arenado identified @TimAnderson7’s superb pickup and throw on the Luis Arraez grounder in the 5th as a game-saving play. Without it, the night probably unravels. Great work by Dave Flemming and @YonderalonsoU to document that in-game. @whitesox, The U.S. and Cuba meet tomorrow in the @WBCBaseball for the first time — with a berth in the final on the line. @MLBNetwork @MLB, This is one of the best, loudest, wildest sporting events I've witnessed in my life -- and it's not over yet. <br /><br />👀<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Trea Turner. <br /><br />Grand slam. <br /><br />USA 9, Venezuela 7. <br /><br />Lots of baseball left in Miami tonight. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Jose Quijada strands two with a contentious strikeout of Kyle Tucker. The ballpark is pulsing with noise, and 🇻🇪 is 6 outs from their first semifinal since 2009. @WBCBaseball @MLBNetwork, Venezuela 6, USA 5. <br /><br />Top of the 7th. <br /><br />Venezuela is 9 outs away from meeting Cuba in the @WBCBaseball for the first time since 2006. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Kyle Tucker homers off @Astros teammate Luis Garcia. He’s 3-for-3 tonight, and the U.S. lead is 5-2. @WBCBaseball @MLBNetwork, I was at 2017 USA-Dominican Republic in Miami, which is peak @WBCBaseball in my opinion. And the atmosphere tonight is very similar for 🇺🇸 and 🇻🇪. @MLBNetwork @MLB, Luis Arráez evidently likes his new ballpark. <br /><br />Two-run homer. <br /><br />USA 3, Venezuela 2. <br /><br />Still the 1st inning. This is going to be a classic. <br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork @Marlins, Team USA has begun the game with 5 singles. As @YonderalonsoU observed on our broadcast, 4 have been to the opposite field. The U.S. lead is 3-0, and Martín Pérez is out of the game with 1 out in the 1st inning. @MLBNetwork @MLB, Mookie Betts has put on a baserunning clinic in this @WBCBaseball. USA leads, 1-0, in the first inning, thanks to his smarts and his speed. @MLBNetwork, The ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ is so much fun. Every night. Every team. Each in their own way. ⁦@LasMayores⁩ ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ @MLB https://t.co/3rTpjhndSL, Thunderous ovations for 🇻🇪 during introductions.

Single-elimination baseball has arrived. Here’s my essay reflecting on what the @WBCBaseball means now in the 🇺🇸. @MLBNetwork @MLB https://t.co/B4Xn9cglo0, Tremendous work by the classy and talented @juanctoribio throughout this @WBCBaseball! Grateful to be his @MLBNetwork teammate., . @MikeTrout’s joy in representing @USABaseball at the @WBCBaseball has elevated the tournament itself — and propelled 🇺🇸 to the quarterfinal. I really enjoyed interviewing him after the crucial win last night. @MLB @MLBNetwork https://t.co/CwyfrdC12E, Tim Anderson is a difference-making defender, no matter where he plays. Brilliant tag. Huge momentum play. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @WhiteSox, Mike Trout tonight: 3-for-3. Triple. 3 RBI. <br /><br />The game American baseball fans have dreamed about since Trout signed on to play for @USABaseball.   <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Mike Trout, Captain America, has a @WBCBaseball Moment. <br /><br />Lead-changing base hit. <br /><br />USA 3, Colombia 2, and Chase Field is alive again. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @Angels, Colombia 2, United States 1, and we've got a tense ballgame at Chase Field. <br /><br />👀 <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @WBCBaseball, One of the great honors of my career to interview Rio Gomez today on @MLBNetwork. Pedro’s influence and inspiration are with me always, and I know he’s been smiling down on Chase Field this week. ❤️ @ArizonaBaseball @RedSoxPlayerDev @RedSox @Cronkite_ASU, First inning: Mike Trout, stand-up triple. 👀 @MLBNetwork @Angels, Rowdy Tellez shared what it means to his family that he’s representing 🇲🇽 in the @WBCBaseball — and now moving on to Miami. @MLBNetwork @Brewers @MLB_Mexico @LasMayores https://t.co/mj53DkQnFS, México’s quarterfinal will mark the first time 🇲🇽 has played a @WBCBaseball game in South Florida. @FSRadioMX @FOXSportsMX @FOXDeportes @MLBNetwork @MLB_Mexico, Rowdy Tellez, with consistent plate appearances all day, rewarded with his first home run of this @WBCBaseball. <br /><br />México 10, Canada 3, and @MexicoBeis is drawing closer to their first-ever WBC game in South Florida. <br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork @MLB_Mexico, México leads, 7-2, through 6 innings. <br /><br />@MexicoBeis is 9 outs from advancing out of the @WBCBaseball first round, which they last achieved in 2009. <br /><br />And their sights are set even higher. <br /><br />🇲🇽 <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLBONFOX @FOXDeportes @FOXSportsMX @MLB_Mexico, Massive moment: Randy Arozarena with *another* clutch double. <br /><br />Three runs score. <br /><br />México 6, Canada 2. <br /><br />The Chase Field chant: \"RAN-DY!

Eighth inning. <br /><br />Bo Naylor, 23, and Owen Caissie, 20, have the RBI. <br /><br />Noah Skirrow, 24, was brilliant with 5 scoreless innings. <br /><br />Could be a watershed @WBCBaseball moment for @baseballcanada. <br /><br />@Sportsnet @MLBNetwork, Rio Gomez's line at Chase Field: <br /><br />1 1/3 IP<br /><br />0 H<br /><br />0 R<br /><br />1 BB<br /><br />2 SO<br /><br />And a multitude of emotion for so many. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @RedSox @ArizonaBaseball @MLB, Rio Gomez just pitched a scoreless inning in the @WBCBaseball. <br /><br />I could see Sandi Gomez's proud smile from across the ballpark. <br /><br />Overwhelming emotions for so many at Chase Field -- including those of us wearing press credentials. <br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork, Rio Gomez is pitching in the @WBCBaseball, at Chase Field, and I'm reporting with a tear in my eye. <br /><br />Sandi Gomez is here at the ballpark, and our dear friend Pedro is watching with pride from above. ❤️ <br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork, Noah Skirrow, the @Phillies prospect from @LibertyBaseball, is showing that he's @MLB ready. <br /><br />4 scoreless innings thus far today for @baseballcanada against a good Colombian lineup. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLBONFOX, Update: Canada 1, Colombia 0. <br /><br />Bo Naylor with a tremendous at-bat -- and 2-out RBI -- in tough left-left matchup against Reiver Sanmartín. <br /><br />Naylor had a .976 OPS vs. LHP at Double-A last year. Very impressive. <br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork @CleGuardians, We're scoreless through 3 innings, and @baseballcanada's superb defense has kept it that way. <br /><br />Brilliant throw by Bo Naylor, and tag by Otto Lopez, to deny the speedy Oscar Mercado of a stolen base. <br /><br />Crisp, tense start to today's CAN-COL matinee.<br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork, L’interview française d’aujourd’hui: Phillippe Aumont expliqué la fierté pour Adam Loewen, son retour dans l’équipe nationale et la présence québécoise avec ⁦@baseballcanada⁩. 🇨🇦 ⁦@TVASports⁩ ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ https://t.co/zh5N2rF6By, Pivotal ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ matchup starts at the top of the hour: ⁦@baseballcanada⁩ vs. Colombia, both 1-1, meet at 3 pm ET.

Captain America. <br /><br />This is the lineup we expected to see.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Mike Trout has homered for Team USA. <br /><br />It's 9-0. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, USA 4, Canada 0, and Mitch Bratt's day is done with 1 out in the first.<br /><br />The Rangers prospect has a bright future -- but the misfortune of being on the mound on the night Team USA's bats awoke. <br /><br />Through 2 games, Canada's starters recorded a total of 3 outs. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Merci beaucoup à ⁦@russellmartin55⁩ pour son temps ce soir avant le match du ⁦@baseballcanada⁩, dans cette conversation pour ⁦@TVASports⁩. 🇨🇦 ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ ⁦@baseballquebec⁩ https://t.co/IHYOdme9U5, Pregame reunion of Yomiuri Giants teammates Miles Mikolas and ⁦@mathieson_scott⁩.

Here's my look at a transcendent moment in the countries' shared history: https://t.co/H4oZgyF0qh @MLBNetwork @MLB_Mexico @MLBONFOX @FOXDeportes, This, my friends, is an all-time photo from the great @StephenNelson. 🇯🇵 @MLBNetwork @MLB, Joining @MLBNetwork live in a moment with a postgame report on @USABaseball. ⚾️, The U.S.-México baseball rivalry, dormant for a decade, revives Sunday at a sold-out Chase Field. It will be loud, intense, and possibly the start of something great. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@MLB_Mexico⁩ ⁦@FOXDeportes⁩ ⁦@LasMayores⁩ 🇺🇸🇲🇽  https://t.co/H4oZgyF0qh, Bobby Witt Jr. is showing today why Mark DeRosa wanted him on the roster. <br /><br />He's 2-for-2, including a hustle infield single. <br /><br />Stolen base. Run scored. <br /><br />He will make an impact on this team. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @Royals, Team USA's pitching has been brilliant today. <br /><br />Merrill Kelly, Daniel Bard, Devin Williams, and Brooks Raley combined for 6 shutout innings -- and 0 walks allowed. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB @USABaseball, Mike Trout draws a walk, departs for a pinch runner, and exits to a warm ovation in Tempe. He ends the day 0-for-2 with a walk. <br /><br />His next at-bat comes in the @WBCBaseball opener vs. Great Britain on Saturday night. <br /><br />@MLB @MLBNetwork, One key decision for DeRosa on Sunday is whether Schwarber, McNeil or Mullins starts against the left-hander.<br /><br />Option 1: Tucker LF, Betts RF, McNeil 2B<br /><br />Option 2: Mullins LF, Tucker RF, Betts 2B<br /><br />Option 3: Schwarber LF, Tucker RF, Betts 2B  <br /><br />🤔<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Thinking some more about the U.S. lineup options, and I expect Kyle Tucker starts Sunday vs. LHP Patrick Sandoval. <br /><br />Tucker is the most successful Team USA hitter against Sandoval in @MLB play: 5-for-11, 7 RBI. <br /><br />Tucker also hit 13 of his 30 HR last year vs. LHP.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Nolan Arenado just hit a grand slam for @USABaseball. <br /><br />Team USA 4, Angels 0.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Storyline to watch on @MLBNetwork now, as Team USA visits the Angels: They are facing a good left-handed pitcher, Tyler Anderson, just as they will Sunday with Team Mexico's Patrick Sandoval.<br /><br />LH-hitting Jeff McNeil, reigning @MLB batting champ, isn't in the starting lineup., 1st inning: Mookie Betts turns a double play at second base, because of course he does. @MLBNetwork, Shohei always delivers. Here’s our conversation on @MLBNetwork. @Angels https://t.co/jKfODEaoTQ, Mookie Betts, today’s ⁦@USABaseball⁩ starting second baseman, on air with ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩. @Dodgers ⁦@MLB⁩ https://t.co/6d8HYIKeaT, Mookie Betts on ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩, with fans gathering around to listen in Tempe.

He’s out here early getting ground balls at second and short. He gets his work in, in right. He’s a pro’s pro. There’s a reason he’s a superstar.” @MLBNetwork @Dodgers @MLB, Adam Ottavino is on the mound for @USABaseball now in Scottsdale.<br /><br />This is his first @WBCBaseball with Team USA -- but not his first Classic overall. He started one game for Italy in 2009 and pitched 3 scoreless innings. <br /><br />@IABF5 @FIBSpress @MLBNetwork, Mookie Betts tonight: 3 plate appearances, 3 times on base. <br /><br />He just hit a laser to the wall in center for a double. <br /><br />Great night of work for No. 3. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @USABaseball, Mark DeRosa spoke with Mike Krzyzewski (5 Olympic gold medals) about leading Team USA.<br /><br />Coach K told him, “Remember that you’re not *playing* for the United States. You *are* the United States.”<br /><br />🇺🇸<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @USABaseball @usabasketball @MLB, Michael Young, a ⁦Team USA coach at the ‘23 ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩, led off in the upset loss to México that ended Team USA’s WBC run in 2006.

Rodney Linares spoke with me about the keys to managing such a talented staff. @MLBNetwork @LasMayores @FedobeRD @ESPN_DO @TudnRadio @TUDNUSA https://t.co/poM24vx0kp, NEWS: Pitchers and catchers report two weeks from *today* if they are listed on final @WBCBaseball rosters. <br /><br />Spring Training is almost here. 😁<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, A moment of appreciation for the @Dodgers' sustained success: <br /><br />Since 2019, they have a .670 winning percentage in the regular season. <br /><br />.670! <br /><br />Their combined record (366-180) is 29 games better than the No. 2 @MLB team (Houston) in that span.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLBStats, Why are the Rays so good?<br /><br />They have agreed to multiyear extensions with Yandy Díaz, Jeffrey Springs, and Peter Fairbanks. <br /><br />All were acquired via trade, at the combined cost of 4 players and cash; only 1 of those players (Nick Solak) appeared in @MLB last year.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Yandy Díaz had a 143 OPS+ last year -- which ranked 13th among all @MLB hitters with at least 500 plate appearances. <br /><br />For context, Shohei Ohtani ranked 12th. 👀<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @RaysBaseball, 🇺🇸 @WBCBaseball @MLBNetwork, Good morning!

Congratulations to a legend! @MLBNetwork @MLB, The official @baseballhall announcement is moments away on @MLBNetwork! Please join us from Cooperstown. ⚾️ @MLB, Adalberto Mondesí trade is fascinating for #RedSox. He should recover from ACL surgery in time for Opening Day, but he's not likely to be a full-time shortstop due to needing days off. Mondesí, 27, has started more than 60 games at shortstop in only one MLB season. @MLBNetwork, Brad Ausmus is among the remaining candidates to become the next #Astros general manager, as @OrtizKicks reported earlier today. <br /><br />Ausmus, the @dartmouth alum, was viewed as a potential @MLB GM before becoming the manager in Detroit 9 years ago. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, We’re live now from Cooperstown! Please join us on @MLBNetwork. Special day here at the @baseballhall. ⚾️ @MLB, My favorite broadcast location of the year. ❤️⚾️ @MLBNetwork @baseballhall @MLB, Happy Hall of Fame Election Day!

If that holds true, he would be elected with 75.1%. <br /><br />This could be decided by &amp;lt;5 ballots, one way or the other.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, “This cat should be in the Hall of Fame,” Dusty Baker said of Jeff Kent. <br /><br />Highly recommend this @ladsonbill24 story. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, I love Cooperstown in summer, of course, but days like this are the absolute best. @MLB ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@baseballhall⁩ ⚾️❄️ https://t.co/EQkXJADiza, Our live reports on @MLBNetwork from Cooperstown begin with Hot Stove this morning at 9 am ET. Thrilled to be here with my friends Brian Kenny and @jaysonst! @baseballhall, One of my new favorite @WBCBaseball quotes comes from @GB_Baseball manager Drew Spencer (@kayperbeats): He described national team baseball as an \"infinite game\" in which @j_chisholm3, native of The Bahamas, can impact generations. @MLBNetwork @Marlins @MLB @PlayersAlliance https://t.co/zog5nH7xf9, Important update after today’s trade. ⬇️ @MLBNetwork, Big day in @MLB on Tuesday, with @baseballhall election reveal.

Great story for @MLB. @MLBNetwork, On @MLBNetwork in a moment to talk @WBCBaseball! 🌎 @MLB, @GarysheffieldJr @toriihunter48 @baseballhall @MLBNetwork @MLB @Twins I did vote for Gary Sr., just as I did last year!, I voted for @toriihunter48 on my @baseballhall ballot. He’s one of 4 players ever with 1500+ games in CF, 350+ HR, and 9+ Gold Gloves. The others: Mays, Griffey, Andruw Jones. @MLBNetwork @MLB @Twins https://t.co/DiERGBQYSq, Venezuela is hosting the Caribbean Series for the first time in 9 years, at Estadio La Rinconada in Caracas. Omar López, manager of the Venezuelan @WBCBaseball team, spoke about the significance of the event for the Venezuelan baseball community. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @LasMayores @Astros https://t.co/keltx6xIIZ, . @MikeTrout is Captain America. 🇺🇸 @Angels @MLBNetwork, Loved talking with Drew Spencer (@kayperbeats), @GB_Baseball manager, about his journey from California, to @BigGreenBasebal, to the @WBCBaseball. <br /><br />He told me great stories about what he learned playing for Bob Whalen — and competing against @markdero7. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLBEurope https://t.co/3aazOovNWf, Omar López, mánager de Venezuela en el @WBCBaseball, me dijo la importancia del torneo para la gente venezolana, y también el significado de la Serie del Caribe que está a punto de comenzar en Caracas. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @LasMayores @FOXDeportes @Astros @LosAstros https://t.co/WNGeea37LL, How much does @JuanSoto25_ want to play in the @WBCBaseball?<br /><br />He told Dominican Republic manager @RondeyLinares that he would bat ninth if that is what it takes. <br /><br />Love this.

He appeared in 10 different @MLB seasons. Very few people in this world can say they have done that. @MLBNetwork, Rodney Linares was a minor league manager in 2017, when he attended the epic USA-DR @WBCBaseball matchup in Miami as a fan. Now he is managing the Dominican national team — guided by the influence of his father, Julio, the longtime @Astros executive. @MLBNetwork @RaysBaseball https://t.co/oeR0ejCzY0, Jolbert Cabrera highlighted several prospects in the next wave of Colombian talent: @Mariners INF Michael Arroyo (No. 11 in system per @MLBPipeline), @Cubs SS/2B Fabián Pertuz, Cubs RHP Danis Correa, and @CleGuardians INF Dayan Frías, who could start in the WBC. @MLBNetwork 🇨🇴, When Jolbert Cabrera made his @MLB debut in 1998, he was one of 3 active Colombian-born major leaguers. Last season, there were 13. More are coming. Jolbert shared his insights on the future as he prepares to manage Team Colombia in the @WBCBaseball. @MLBNetwork @LasMayores https://t.co/etvGmqzQkc, The @baseballhall voting results will be announced one week from TODAY. <br /><br />Here, for the first time, is my complete ballot. <br /><br />I welcome your criticism -- and support. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB @officialBBWAA, NEWS: @WBCBaseball tickets are available for individual games at @loanDepotpark. I’d recommend this event to anyone, baseball fan or not. The ‘17 WBC games were an all-time memory for me. @MLBNetwork @MLB, If Jeff McNeil officially joins the roster, Team USA will have 4 left-handed hitters: McNeil, Cedric Mullins, Kyle Schwarber, and Kyle Tucker. <br /><br />U.S. @WBCBaseball rosters have been RH-dominant over the years; this is a relatively balanced group.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, News: @USABaseball manager Mark DeRosa said on @MLBNetwork that he has talked with @Mets 2B/OF Jeff McNeil about joining the @WBCBaseball roster following the injury to Trevor Story. <br /><br />DeRosa also said Mookie Betts -- already on the U.S. roster -- will play some 2B. <br /><br />@MLB, Best wishes to all as we celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. today! In honor of the occasion, here are details on great events through the @JRFoundation. 🇺🇸 @MLBNetwork, Sources: @owen_caissie, the No. 10 prospect in @Cubs system per @MLBPipeline, is listed on Canada’s 50-man preliminary roster.

Pitchers and catchers participating in the @WBCBaseball report to @MLB spring training camps one month from today. <br /><br />One month! <br /><br />😁<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLBONFOX, #Mets have remained in contact with free agents Andrew McCutchen and Trey Mancini, as others have reported. <br /><br />Of note: Buck Showalter was Mancini's manager in Baltimore for his first two full @MLB seasons. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, News: Pitchers and catchers participating in the @WBCBaseball will report to their respective @MLB team camps by Monday, Feb. 13. <br /><br />That’s only 32 days from now. <br /><br />32! <br /><br />The 2023 season is upon us. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Japan is the only nation to win @WBCBaseball multiple times, yet this could be the greatest @samuraijapan_pr roster ever. <br /><br />Shohei Ohtani. Yu Darvish. Seiya Suzuki. Munetaka Murakami. Rōki Sasaki. Lars Nootbaar. Yoshinobu Yamamoto. <br /><br />And more names to come. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Great news for Team Israel at @WBCBaseball:<br /><br />@Cubs 1B prospect Matt Mervis (@mmervis12) is listed on Israel’s preliminary tournament roster. Mervis posted a .984 OPS with 36 HR in 137 games at 3 affiliates in 2022.<br /><br />@ILBaseball @MLBNetwork @MLBPipeline @WatchMarquee, Sources: #Rangers among most serious suitors for Bryan Reynolds.

The 28-year-old posted a career-best 1.118 WHIP in 107 1/3 IP last season.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, I voted for Scott Rolen on my HOF ballot again. Of note, Aramis Ramírez’s HOF candidacy is much closer to Rolen’s than Ramírez’s one-and-done showing (1%) suggests. Ramírez finished with more G, HR, and RBI than Rolen. Like McGriff, I hope his case is reconsidered. @MLBNetwork, News from Detroit: The #Tigers are changing the dimensions at Comerica Park for 2023. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, One point on #Mets raised by @williamfleitch in his @MLB.com column: They had the third-oldest position player group in the majors last year. <br /><br />In 2023, the Mets will have only 2 everyday position players -- Lindor and Alonso -- in their age-29 season or younger. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, The #Rangers are among the top remaining suitors for #Pirates OF Bryan Reynolds, as I just reported on @MLBNetwork. <br /><br />The Pirates want high-upside pitching prospects for Reynolds, and Texas has 3 pitchers among the @MLBPipeline Top 100: Leiter, White, and Porter. <br /><br />@MLB, Great suggestion here by @pgammo: Nick Ahmed is a smooth-fielding Massachusetts native who goes back more than a decade with Peter Fatse. @MLBNetwork, On @MLBNetwork now with the breaking news., Carlos Correa and #Twins in agreement pending physical, source confirms @JeffPassan report. @MLBNetwork @MLB, What an outstanding program to help talented young people in the @MLB industry.

So many great moments to celebrate. <br /><br />Can't for all that's to come in 2023 -- starting with @WBCBaseball. <br /><br />@MLB_PR @MLBNetwork, This news is (a) important and (b) completely unsurprising. 😂 @MLBNetwork, My thoughts on Daulton Varsho joining the #BlueJays, from #MLBNHotStove this morning on @MLBNetwork. 🇨🇦  https://t.co/1P0f7jLLxk, Fascinating early data from @NotMrTibbs.

There could be an opening in Miami's rotation if they trade Pablo López. <br /><br />@MLB @MLBNetwork, Justin Verlander said at today's press conference that he's working out with new/old teammate Max Scherzer this offseason in Jupiter, Fla. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Max Schrock has agreed with #Padres on a minor-league contract that includes an invite to #MLB spring training, source says.

Schrock, 28, is a career .299 hitter in the minors and plays all around the diamond. @MLBNetwork, Source: #Reds have expressed interest in a reunion with Johnny Cueto, a free agent after pitching 158 1/3 innings this year. <br /><br />Cueto, who turns 37 in February, made his @MLB debut with Cincinnati in 2008. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, #Orioles showing continued interest in Michael Wacha, whose market could move quickly now that Syndergaard and Lorenzen reportedly have reached agreements elsewhere. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, We’re live on @MLBNetwork one hour from now on a big morning in @MLB: Carlos Correa has a 13-year deal with the #SFGiants, tied for the longest free-agent contract in baseball history.

Amazing insight on the philosophy of hitting — and importance of adjustments., The #BlueJays are a team to watch in the Bryan Reynolds market. They have interest in him and want to add an athletic switch hitter to their outfield. Based on strong industry interest, Jays would likely need to include Tiedemann or Martínez to have high offer. @MLBNetwork @MLB, #DBacks among the most serious Xander Bogaerts suitors, as I mentioned today on @MLBNetwork.

Aurilia described Kent’s defense at 2B as above average at the very least. @SFGiants, Thrilled to have @USC_Athletics baseball coach Andy Stankiewicz (@turntwo17) join us live on #MLBNHotStove. @MLBNetwork @pac12, Source: RHP Chris Devenski is in agreement with #Angels on a 1-year contract. @MLBNetwork @MLB, Sources: #Mariners among teams showing interest in free agent OF Michael Conforto, the Redmond (Wash.)
