I say none. Now on @undisputed, Mark Cuban says his goal is to re-sign Kyrie. I can’t believe Luka will love that. Now on @undisputed, The more Cam Newton tries to clarify, the more confusing it gets. Now on @undisputed, I'm going to give LeBron a break here because he’s 38 and has high milage on his body. I was happy and impressed that both LeBron &amp;amp; AD said \"let’s go\" before tip-off. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Will the Lakers make the playoffs or only the Play-In? That all depends on whether Kevin Durant plays back-to-back Friday night at Lakers. Now on @undisputed, Mark Cuban tries to talk his way out of the mistake he made not re-signing Jalen Brunson.

Now on @undisputed, Peter King reports the Texans might just throw a curveball at No. 2 and take defensive end Will Anderson instead of a quarterback. WHAT!? Now on @undisputed, This was a swing and a miss. Mark Cuban traded Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, a 1st round pick AND two 2nd round picks for Kyrie Irving, who has been a bust — at least in the win column. More @undisputed, now on FS1. <br />https://t.co/so8bPhtoZc, Shannon has already bet me that the Celtics will go 4-0 against the Sixers by winning tonight at Philly. He’s wrong.

Now on @undisputed, This NBA MVP race is going down to the wire. We debate now on @undisputed, You’ve got two guys who on any given night can be unguardable, and they do exactly the same thing.

Now on @undisputed, I’m liking this Laker team more and more. Now on @undisputed, Deion Sanders tweets about Lamar Jackson.

SHOULD PHOENIX NOW BE THE FAVORITE TO WIN IT ALL? NOW ON @undisputed, The NFL approves the use of No. 0. Micah wanted it but Jayron Kearse beat him to the punch. Now on @undisputed, Lamar Jackson is a QB who can win a Super Bowl for you and is a former MVP. Quarterbacks always get a lot of money because it's the premium position. HE IS PROVEN! More @undisputed, now on FS1., Because of the social media world, the pressure on this kid is staggering to me. The pressure is equal to what his father went through because there’s more of it today.

I love their chances. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Bronny finished 2nd last night in the McDonald’s dunk contest. We react now on @undisputed, I LOVED every word that came out of Gutekunst’s mouth yesterday. He went scorched earth and put it all on Aaron Rodgers, who I have always said is a master manipulator. More @undisputed, now on FS1., JOEL EMBIID, MVP! NOW ON @undisputed, You have to step back from all this and say: “Wait a second! It’s LAMAR JACKSON!” He’s there for the  taking.

Ja did that, he brought all of it on himself. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Who will win the game of “chicken” between the Packers and Jets over Aaron Rodgers? Now on @undisputed, I believe Mario Chalmers was speaking about THEN, not NOW. In that period, he didn’t see fear in the eyes of opponents the way he was told players feared Jordan. But now, when Bron decides he's going downhill toward the rim, who can stop him? More @undisputed, now on FS1., Did Embiid lose ground in the MVP race? Or was the double OT loss to the Bulls all James Harden’s fault? Now on @undisputed, In a vacuum is this a big deal? Of course not. But in context, it's not the best look to quote that rap lyric just as you're coming back from dangling a gun.

More @undisputed, now on FS1., It sounds like The GOAT, Michael Jordan, is ready to give up on trying to turnaround the Charlotte Hornets.

Now on @undisputed, No Kevin Durant last night. And it wasn't like Steph was doing it to Phoenix, it was Klay! Stop it. More @undisputed, now on FS1., LAMAR JACKSON: WHAT ARE TEAMS WAITING FOR? NOW ON @undisputed, I am applauding Ja Morant. If he has a problem, he acknowledged it and gave into it right away. More @undisputed, now on FS1., Steph trash talks CP3, saying “this ain’t 2014 no more.” HUH??? Now on @undisputed, While Jimmy G is a little better, Derek Carr is much more durable. You're on borrowed time and the clock is ticking because history tells you Jimmy is going to get hurt. More @undisputed, now on FS1., What in the name of Brett Favre is going on with Aaron Rodgers? Now on @undisputed, Join Shannon and me now on @undisputed as we debate Jimmy G and Ja., Embiid keeps closing the MVP gap with Jokic.

It's time for AD to step up and show you he can do it on a nightly basis.

More @undisputed, now on FS1., After Odell’s workout, will his free agent stock by hot, cool, or cold? Now on @undisputed, If I take Jalen Ramsey as an acquisition by himself, I give this a 9. But when I put him in the context of the Dolphins, I gotta pull it back to a 5. More @undisputed, now on FS1., I’m starting to wonder if Aaron Rodgers has the guts to go to New York as the Jets savior? Now on @undisputed, LeBron returns without a walking boot.

So we cooked.. after just few days @WCKitchen #ChefsForPuertoRico opened a second kitchen. Volunteers from all over came to help. Puerto Ricans feeding Puerto Ricans!, I'm a cook, and what I saw around me everywhere was so many people who what they needed was a hot meal. From my friend Jose Enrique's restaurant in Santurce @WCKitchen started making Sancocho. We started with one pot, one kitchen but so quickly #ChefsForPuertoRico grew., 5 years ago #HurricaneMaria hit the island of Puerto Rico.. the lives of millions of people changed forever. I got on the first flight I could get &amp;amp; when I landed it was devastation like I've never seen before. So we @WCKitchen did the only thing we knew, started cooking... 🇵🇷 https://t.co/h69ts2ru4B, I always said that we will have a hurricane that will be a multiple event hitting different countries, Many islands, leaving destruction behind.

Anthony’s mother, Isabelle, was born in the Philippines and is now an anesthesiologist. 🇵🇭 @MLBNetwork @MLB, Gerrit Cole has the first 10+ strikeout performance by a @Yankees starter on Opening Day, as Matt Vasgersian just said on our @MLBNetwork broadcast. @MLB, . @GerritCole45: 6 strikeouts through 2 innings. I’ve checked the math, and that’s pretty impressive. 👀 @MLBNetwork, Aaron Judge, home run. Second pitch he saw in his first at-bat as the #Yankees captain. M-V-P chants in the Bronx in the first inning on Opening Day. @MLBNetwork, Anthony Volpe kissed the “NY” on his jersey as the Bleacher Creatures chanted his name during the roll call. @MLBNetwork @MLB, Join us on @MLBNetwork! First pitch of the season is moments away. @MLB, The Giants experience #OpeningDay in New York for the first time in over 60 years. @MLB ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ https://t.co/Up86Gt1Zka, Blake Sabol starts in left field for the @SFGiants today in his @MLB debut at Yankee Stadium.

Great story from @JackCurryYES here about how that came to be. <br /><br />Thrilled to have the Yankees and #SFGiants as our @MLBNetwork Showcase tomorrow, beginning at 1 pm ET., Miles Mastrobuoni is a great story from the @WBCBaseball.

The Tokyo Dome is one possible host venue. WBSC President Riccardo Fraccari told me the tournament could consist of two 6-team groups prior to the semifinal and final. @MLBNetwork 🇯🇵, . @WBSC President Riccardo Fraccari told me of the @WBCBaseball: “The real value in the tournament is showing how important it is to internationalize our sport. This tournament shows the real power of baseball and softball in the world.” @MLBNetwork @PlayBall, Great perspective here from @MikeTrout. He captured perfectly the sentiments of so many with Team USA: They were grateful to have been part of a tournament that honored and elevated the sport and will reverberate for years. 🇺🇸 @MLBNetwork @USABaseball @MLB, Before, we talked about what the @WBCBaseball could become. Now we can marvel with gratitude and pride at what it *is*. May the magic of this tournament remain with us in the season ahead — and sustain us until the baseball world gathers once again. 🌎 @MLB @MLBNetwork, History: Japan is the first country to concurrently hold the ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩, Olympic, and ⁦@WBSC⁩ @Premier12 (or Baseball World Cup) titles. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ 🇯🇵 https://t.co/6wbi4eI6X5, News: Shohei Ohtani named @WBCBaseball MVP. 🇯🇵 @MLBNetwork, Kyle Schwarber. Epic 10-pitch at-bat. Second-deck homer. Japan’s lead is 3-2. @MLBNetwork, On the mound when Japan last won the WBC? Yu Darvish, 14 years ago. On the mound now? Yu Darvish. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ @MLB https://t.co/5pRhUzLJ53, Team Japan is 6 outs away from holding the @WBCBaseball, Olympic and @WBSC @Premier12 titles concurrently. 🥇🇯🇵 @MLBNetwork, Mike Trout’s next at-bat could come against Shohei Ohtani in the 9th inning. Seriously. If you check your scorecard, that’s how it’s lining up. 👀 @MLBNetwork @MLB, Shohei Ohtani, entering the bullpen. He last appeared in relief in 2016, according to our ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ researcher Kevin Dillon. @MLB ⁦⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ 🇯🇵 https://t.co/0tCrPkFgTw, News: Shohei Ohtani just walked to the Team Japan bullpen. @MLBNetwork, Yu Darvish on his way to the bullpen. Japan leads 3-1 in the 5th. @MLB ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ https://t.co/o9MLsZ7sDY, For now, Ohtani and Darvish remain in the dugout — not warming up. 👀 ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ @MLB https://t.co/a1YP6c1ove, Okamoto leads off the 4th with a solo home run to left-center, and Japan leads 3-1. Team USA will need a comeback — as in the quarterfinal vs. Venezuela — if they’re going to repeat as @WBCBaseball champs. @MLBNetwork, Aaron Loup, the last player added to the U.S. roster (in place of Brooks Raley), takes over with the bases loaded in the 2nd inning. @MLBNetwork, Munetaka Murakami’s last two pitches: walk-off hit last night, second-deck home run to tie the @WBCBaseball championship at 1-1. @MLBNetwork 🇯🇵, Trea Turner. Again! ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ https://t.co/NUzl9xZ0Ns, Samurai Japan. 🇯🇵 @MLBNetwork https://t.co/c98Qv4ZlEX, I am very happy tonight. 😁 @MLBNetwork @WBCBaseball, Our @MLBNetwork interview with Rōki Sasaki. His emotions in the moment were so palpable. Can’t wait to see what tonight will bring. @WBCBaseball @MLB https://t.co/ELsZV1qLx0, Last year, Japan celebrated the 150th anniversary of baseball's introduction to the country by Horace Wilson, a teacher from Maine. According to Nobby Ito of NPB, the first recorded game there took place in 1871 and included the visiting crew of the USS Colorado. @MLBNetwork, Our interview with Munetaka Murakami, moments after the walk-off. @WBCBaseball @MLBNetwork @MLBNetworkPR 🇯🇵 https://t.co/qzxVvvNnL8, One Spanish journalist covering the @WBCBaseball told me, \"Esto es como el Mundial.\"<br /><br />\"This is like the World Cup.\" <br /><br />In Spain, this is not casual praise. <br /><br />The 2023 WBC is an inflection point for the tournament -- and sport of baseball. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, News: Merrill Kelly confirmed as @USABaseball starter in the @WBCBaseball final today. Shōta Imanaga will start for @samuraijapan_pr. First ever matchup of 🇺🇸 and 🇯🇵 in a WBC final. Let’s go, baseball world! @MLBNetwork @MLB @Dbacks, México made a massive statement on the grandest stage -- in athleticism, style of play, and passion of their fans. México has limitless potential as a first-class baseball country. This @WBCBaseball will inspire a generation.<br /><br />@MLB_Mexico @MLBNetwork @MexicoBeis @MLB, Shohei Ohtani will come out of the bullpen and face Mike Trout with the @WBCBaseball title on the line. At this point, I see no other way this tournament ends. @MLB @MLBNetwork, Japan did not lead tonight until the winning run crossed the plate. 👀 @MLBNetwork, Shohei Ohtani leads off in the 9th, with Team Japan down 1 run. <br /><br />The 2023 @WBCBaseball finds ways to entertain us in ways no sporting event has before. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Observation: Rōki Sasaki has barely moved from the top step of Team Japan's dugout since he left the mound. He's supporting his teammates and so engaged with this game. Sign of a great teammate. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, México 5, Japan 3. <br /><br />A U.S.-México @WBCBaseball final is 6 outs away. <br /><br />@MLB_Mexico @MLBNetwork, Masataka Yoshida. <br /><br />3-run home run. <br /><br />WE ARE TIED. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Great line from @YonderalonsoU on our broadcast about the impact of Randy Arozarena in left field tonight. <br /><br />\"He's hit a grand slam -- on defense.\"<br /><br />👀<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Ohtani at the plate. Look at this place. The ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ is magic. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ https://t.co/2d2OgIjcNa, From the man himself! 👀 <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Randy. Arozarena. <br /><br />Home run robbery. <br /><br />He is an absolute marvel. <br /><br />RAN-DY! RAN-DY! RAN-DY! is the chant. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB_Mexico @MLB, México leads 3-0 in the 5th. <br /><br />Fans of Samurai Japan surely have visions of offensive struggles after long layoffs before the '13 and '17 @WBCBaseball semifinals.<br /><br />2013: Puerto Rico 3, Japan 1<br /><br />2017: USA 2, Japan 1<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Luis Urías, 3-run homer. <br /><br />México 3, Japan 0. <br /><br />The ballpark is roaring with noise. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @WBCBaseball @Brewers, Team Japan’s dugout with Shohei at the plate. No one — no one — sitting down. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ @MLB https://t.co/yDVOyE1bmb, Great moment: Rōki Sasaki thanked his fielders after the top of the first — even though, to be fair, he did not need much help. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ https://t.co/psg7QjKNxN, Rōki Sasaki just struck out Randy Arozarena with a 102-mph fastball. First batter of the game. Wow! 🇯🇵 @MLBNetwork @WBCBaseball @MLB, Team Japan. 🇯🇵 ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ @MLB https://t.co/ap0tG6GKlV, So great to have Lars Nootbaar on ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ now talking about the amazing experience of playing for ⁦@samuraijapan_pr⁩. ⁦@Cardinals⁩ ⁦@MLBNetworkPR⁩ ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ https://t.co/X1gY2A1J7e, Join us now on @MLBNetwork!

Listen to the awe and applause after the prodigious BP home run. 👀 @MLB ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ 🇯🇵 https://t.co/wbpmAHINFt, Japan is 5-0 in this @WBCBaseball, but tonight they need to overcome a trend in recent tournaments:<br /><br />Teams traveling across the Pacific have lost 5 straight semifinals. <br /><br />2013: PR defeats JPN; DR defeats NED<br />2017: PR defeats NED; USA defeats JPN<br />2023: USA defeats CUB<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Amazing experience to work with @RichWaltz, Buck Martinez and our outstanding @MLBNetwork crew. Loved our conversations on and off the air. I’ll cherish those memories forever. ⚾️ @WBCBaseball, Great line from Paul Goldschmidt. <br /><br />I asked what he told @treavturner after his 2nd HR tonight. <br /><br />Goldy joked: “Quit showing us up!” <br /><br />The NL MVP is one of the classiest players in the game. Really enjoyed this postgame conversation. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB <br />https://t.co/g0HzfH8XGk, Cedric Mullins has his ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ moment with a HR to straightaway CF, and ⁦@USABaseball⁩ is 3 outs from the final! Join us on ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ for postgame coverage after the final out. @MLB https://t.co/PfR17I3098, Trea Turner homers AGAIN! <br /><br />USA 12, Cuba 2. <br /><br />\"M-V-P! M-V-P!\" is the chant from fans behind the U.S. dugout. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @USABaseball @Phillies @MLB, Paul Goldschmidt with a gorgeous 2-run single. He has 4 RBI tonight — and Team USA may have another ballgame to play on Tuesday night. @MLBNetwork, USA 6, Cuba 1, after Nolan Arenado’s run-scoring triple and Paul Goldschmidt’s brilliant baserunning. The U.S. has scored in every inning. Through 4 innings, this might be the most complete effort we’ve seen from Team USA in this @WBCBaseball. @MLBNetwork @MLB, As I reported on our broadcast, Trea Turner just threw away one of his batting gloves in a dugout garbage bin. The ferocity of his last HR swing apparently split the material. Still, I was stunned. I thought ballplayers were superstitious. 😂 @MLBNetwork @Phillies @MLB, USA. Cuba. They meet in the @WBCBaseball for the first time, moments from now. @MLBNetwork @MLB https://t.co/aUgLWOg2Na, Yoenis Cespedes (52) se ha regresado al equipo nacional de Cuba. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@FOXDeportes⁩ ⁦@LasMayores⁩ https://t.co/NfCrXx0IMF, Nolan Arenado talked with me about the key moments last night — and the meaning of the first 🇺🇸-🇨🇺 matchup in @WBCBaseball play, with a final berth on the line. @MLBNetwork https://t.co/WZ7E8uFYxy, Team USA’s Ernie Young and Team Cuba’s Pedro Luis Lazo were on opposite sides of the historic gold medal game between 🇺🇸 and 🇨🇺 23 years ago. Here they are today before the ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ semifinal. Thanks to Ernie for sharing the great photo. ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ @MLB https://t.co/WdntTBO5Gg, USA hero Trea Turner, South Florida native, remembers catching one foul ball as a young fan at @Marlins games. <br /><br />Ken Griffey Jr. hit it. <br /><br />Last night, Junior hugged Turner in the U.S. dugout after the go-ahead grand slam. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @Phillies @MLB <br />https://t.co/eY8CvByjKA, Nolan Arenado on @treavturner during our postgame @MLBNetwork interview: <br /><br />“Wow. What a swing. What a player.” https://t.co/WZ7E8uFYxy, Trea Turner told me tonight: “Probably the loudest game I’ve ever played — ever.”<br /><br />Of note, Turner has played 43 @MLB postseason games, including a victorious 7-game World Series. <br /><br />👀<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, I said to @treavturner: “You enter the dugout, and Ken Griffey Jr. — your hitting coach — gives you a hug. To the kid from Lake Worth, Fla., how does that sound?”<br /><br />His answer: “Stupid . . . That sounds crazy.”<br /><br />😂<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB @Phillies <br />https://t.co/eY8CvByjKA, In our @MLBNetwork interview, Nolan Arenado identified @TimAnderson7’s superb pickup and throw on the Luis Arraez grounder in the 5th as a game-saving play. Without it, the night probably unravels. Great work by Dave Flemming and @YonderalonsoU to document that in-game. @whitesox, The U.S. and Cuba meet tomorrow in the @WBCBaseball for the first time — with a berth in the final on the line. @MLBNetwork @MLB, This is one of the best, loudest, wildest sporting events I've witnessed in my life -- and it's not over yet. <br /><br />👀<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Trea Turner. <br /><br />Grand slam. <br /><br />USA 9, Venezuela 7. <br /><br />Lots of baseball left in Miami tonight. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Jose Quijada strands two with a contentious strikeout of Kyle Tucker. The ballpark is pulsing with noise, and 🇻🇪 is 6 outs from their first semifinal since 2009. @WBCBaseball @MLBNetwork, Venezuela 6, USA 5. <br /><br />Top of the 7th. <br /><br />Venezuela is 9 outs away from meeting Cuba in the @WBCBaseball for the first time since 2006. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, Kyle Tucker homers off @Astros teammate Luis Garcia. He’s 3-for-3 tonight, and the U.S. lead is 5-2. @WBCBaseball @MLBNetwork, I was at 2017 USA-Dominican Republic in Miami, which is peak @WBCBaseball in my opinion. And the atmosphere tonight is very similar for 🇺🇸 and 🇻🇪. @MLBNetwork @MLB, Luis Arráez evidently likes his new ballpark. <br /><br />Two-run homer. <br /><br />USA 3, Venezuela 2. <br /><br />Still the 1st inning. This is going to be a classic. <br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork @Marlins, Team USA has begun the game with 5 singles. As @YonderalonsoU observed on our broadcast, 4 have been to the opposite field. The U.S. lead is 3-0, and Martín Pérez is out of the game with 1 out in the 1st inning. @MLBNetwork @MLB, Mookie Betts has put on a baserunning clinic in this @WBCBaseball.

Triple. 3 RBI. <br /><br />The game American baseball fans have dreamed about since Trout signed on to play for @USABaseball.   <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Mike Trout, Captain America, has a @WBCBaseball Moment. <br /><br />Lead-changing base hit. <br /><br />USA 3, Colombia 2, and Chase Field is alive again. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @Angels, Colombia 2, United States 1, and we've got a tense ballgame at Chase Field. <br /><br />👀 <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @WBCBaseball, One of the great honors of my career to interview Rio Gomez today on @MLBNetwork. Pedro’s influence and inspiration are with me always, and I know he’s been smiling down on Chase Field this week. ❤️ @ArizonaBaseball @RedSoxPlayerDev @RedSox @Cronkite_ASU, First inning: Mike Trout, stand-up triple. 👀 @MLBNetwork @Angels, Rowdy Tellez shared what it means to his family that he’s representing 🇲🇽 in the @WBCBaseball — and now moving on to Miami. @MLBNetwork @Brewers @MLB_Mexico @LasMayores https://t.co/mj53DkQnFS, México’s quarterfinal will mark the first time 🇲🇽 has played a @WBCBaseball game in South Florida. @FSRadioMX @FOXSportsMX @FOXDeportes @MLBNetwork @MLB_Mexico, Rowdy Tellez, with consistent plate appearances all day, rewarded with his first home run of this @WBCBaseball. <br /><br />México 10, Canada 3, and @MexicoBeis is drawing closer to their first-ever WBC game in South Florida. <br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork @MLB_Mexico, México leads, 7-2, through 6 innings. <br /><br />@MexicoBeis is 9 outs from advancing out of the @WBCBaseball first round, which they last achieved in 2009. <br /><br />And their sights are set even higher. <br /><br />🇲🇽 <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLBONFOX @FOXDeportes @FOXSportsMX @MLB_Mexico, Massive moment: Randy Arozarena with *another* clutch double. <br /><br />Three runs score. <br /><br />México 6, Canada 2. <br /><br />The Chase Field chant: \"RAN-DY!

Very impressive. <br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork @CleGuardians, We're scoreless through 3 innings, and @baseballcanada's superb defense has kept it that way. <br /><br />Brilliant throw by Bo Naylor, and tag by Otto Lopez, to deny the speedy Oscar Mercado of a stolen base. <br /><br />Crisp, tense start to today's CAN-COL matinee.<br /><br />@MLBONFOX @MLBNetwork, L’interview française d’aujourd’hui: Phillippe Aumont expliqué la fierté pour Adam Loewen, son retour dans l’équipe nationale et la présence québécoise avec ⁦@baseballcanada⁩. 🇨🇦 ⁦@TVASports⁩ ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩ ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ https://t.co/zh5N2rF6By, Pivotal ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩ matchup starts at the top of the hour: ⁦@baseballcanada⁩ vs. Colombia, both 1-1, meet at 3 pm ET.

He ends the day 0-for-2 with a walk. <br /><br />His next at-bat comes in the @WBCBaseball opener vs. Great Britain on Saturday night. <br /><br />@MLB @MLBNetwork, One key decision for DeRosa on Sunday is whether Schwarber, McNeil or Mullins starts against the left-hander.<br /><br />Option 1: Tucker LF, Betts RF, McNeil 2B<br /><br />Option 2: Mullins LF, Tucker RF, Betts 2B<br /><br />Option 3: Schwarber LF, Tucker RF, Betts 2B  <br /><br />🤔<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Thinking some more about the U.S. lineup options, and I expect Kyle Tucker starts Sunday vs. LHP Patrick Sandoval. <br /><br />Tucker is the most successful Team USA hitter against Sandoval in @MLB play: 5-for-11, 7 RBI. <br /><br />Tucker also hit 13 of his 30 HR last year vs. LHP.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Nolan Arenado just hit a grand slam for @USABaseball. <br /><br />Team USA 4, Angels 0.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Storyline to watch on @MLBNetwork now, as Team USA visits the Angels: They are facing a good left-handed pitcher, Tyler Anderson, just as they will Sunday with Team Mexico's Patrick Sandoval.<br /><br />LH-hitting Jeff McNeil, reigning @MLB batting champ, isn't in the starting lineup., 1st inning: Mookie Betts turns a double play at second base, because of course he does. @MLBNetwork, Shohei always delivers. Here’s our conversation on @MLBNetwork. @Angels https://t.co/jKfODEaoTQ, Mookie Betts, today’s ⁦@USABaseball⁩ starting second baseman, on air with ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩. @Dodgers ⁦@MLB⁩ https://t.co/6d8HYIKeaT, Mookie Betts on ⁦@MLBNetwork⁩, with fans gathering around to listen in Tempe.

He’s out here early getting ground balls at second and short. He gets his work in, in right. He’s a pro’s pro. There’s a reason he’s a superstar.” @MLBNetwork @Dodgers @MLB, Adam Ottavino is on the mound for @USABaseball now in Scottsdale.<br /><br />This is his first @WBCBaseball with Team USA -- but not his first Classic overall. He started one game for Italy in 2009 and pitched 3 scoreless innings. <br /><br />@IABF5 @FIBSpress @MLBNetwork, Mookie Betts tonight: 3 plate appearances, 3 times on base. <br /><br />He just hit a laser to the wall in center for a double. <br /><br />Great night of work for No. 3. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @USABaseball, Mark DeRosa spoke with Mike Krzyzewski (5 Olympic gold medals) about leading Team USA.<br /><br />Coach K told him, “Remember that you’re not *playing* for the United States. You *are* the United States.”<br /><br />🇺🇸<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @USABaseball @usabasketball @MLB, Michael Young, a ⁦Team USA coach at the ‘23 ⁦@WBCBaseball⁩, led off in the upset loss to México that ended Team USA’s WBC run in 2006.

He appeared in 10 different @MLB seasons. Very few people in this world can say they have done that. @MLBNetwork, Rodney Linares was a minor league manager in 2017, when he attended the epic USA-DR @WBCBaseball matchup in Miami as a fan. Now he is managing the Dominican national team — guided by the influence of his father, Julio, the longtime @Astros executive. @MLBNetwork @RaysBaseball https://t.co/oeR0ejCzY0, Jolbert Cabrera highlighted several prospects in the next wave of Colombian talent: @Mariners INF Michael Arroyo (No. 11 in system per @MLBPipeline), @Cubs SS/2B Fabián Pertuz, Cubs RHP Danis Correa, and @CleGuardians INF Dayan Frías, who could start in the WBC. @MLBNetwork 🇨🇴, When Jolbert Cabrera made his @MLB debut in 1998, he was one of 3 active Colombian-born major leaguers. Last season, there were 13. More are coming. Jolbert shared his insights on the future as he prepares to manage Team Colombia in the @WBCBaseball. @MLBNetwork @LasMayores https://t.co/etvGmqzQkc, The @baseballhall voting results will be announced one week from TODAY. <br /><br />Here, for the first time, is my complete ballot. <br /><br />I welcome your criticism -- and support. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB @officialBBWAA, NEWS: @WBCBaseball tickets are available for individual games at @loanDepotpark. I’d recommend this event to anyone, baseball fan or not. The ‘17 WBC games were an all-time memory for me. @MLBNetwork @MLB, If Jeff McNeil officially joins the roster, Team USA will have 4 left-handed hitters: McNeil, Cedric Mullins, Kyle Schwarber, and Kyle Tucker. <br /><br />U.S. @WBCBaseball rosters have been RH-dominant over the years; this is a relatively balanced group.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, News: @USABaseball manager Mark DeRosa said on @MLBNetwork that he has talked with @Mets 2B/OF Jeff McNeil about joining the @WBCBaseball roster following the injury to Trevor Story. <br /><br />DeRosa also said Mookie Betts -- already on the U.S. roster -- will play some 2B. <br /><br />@MLB, Best wishes to all as we celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. today! In honor of the occasion, here are details on great events through the @JRFoundation. 🇺🇸 @MLBNetwork, Sources: @owen_caissie, the No. 10 prospect in @Cubs system per @MLBPipeline, is listed on Canada’s 50-man preliminary roster.

Pitchers and catchers participating in the @WBCBaseball report to @MLB spring training camps one month from today. <br /><br />One month! <br /><br />😁<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLBONFOX, #Mets have remained in contact with free agents Andrew McCutchen and Trey Mancini, as others have reported. <br /><br />Of note: Buck Showalter was Mancini's manager in Baltimore for his first two full @MLB seasons. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, News: Pitchers and catchers participating in the @WBCBaseball will report to their respective @MLB team camps by Monday, Feb. 13. <br /><br />That’s only 32 days from now. <br /><br />32! <br /><br />The 2023 season is upon us. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, Japan is the only nation to win @WBCBaseball multiple times, yet this could be the greatest @samuraijapan_pr roster ever. <br /><br />Shohei Ohtani.

The 28-year-old posted a career-best 1.118 WHIP in 107 1/3 IP last season.<br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, I voted for Scott Rolen on my HOF ballot again. Of note, Aramis Ramírez’s HOF candidacy is much closer to Rolen’s than Ramírez’s one-and-done showing (1%) suggests. Ramírez finished with more G, HR, and RBI than Rolen. Like McGriff, I hope his case is reconsidered. @MLBNetwork, News from Detroit: The #Tigers are changing the dimensions at Comerica Park for 2023. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork @MLB, One point on #Mets raised by @williamfleitch in his @MLB.com column: They had the third-oldest position player group in the majors last year. <br /><br />In 2023, the Mets will have only 2 everyday position players -- Lindor and Alonso -- in their age-29 season or younger. <br /><br />@MLBNetwork, The #Rangers are among the top remaining suitors for #Pirates OF Bryan Reynolds, as I just reported on @MLBNetwork. <br /><br />The Pirates want high-upside pitching prospects for Reynolds, and Texas has 3 pitchers among the @MLBPipeline Top 100: Leiter, White, and Porter. <br /><br />@MLB, Great suggestion here by @pgammo: Nick Ahmed is a smooth-fielding Massachusetts native who goes back more than a decade with Peter Fatse. @MLBNetwork, On @MLBNetwork now with the breaking news., Carlos Correa and #Twins in agreement pending physical, source confirms @JeffPassan report. @MLBNetwork @MLB, What an outstanding program to help talented young people in the @MLB industry.

Amazing insight on the philosophy of hitting — and importance of adjustments., The #BlueJays are a team to watch in the Bryan Reynolds market.
